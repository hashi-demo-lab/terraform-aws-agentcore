> **Disclaimer:** These workflows are intended for delivery via RTS (Resident Technical Services) as part of a Professional Services engagement. This repository should not be handed over without guided enablement — agentic infrastructure development requires mature IaC practices, layered guardrails, and operational readiness. Without these foundations, autonomous code generation against live infrastructure carries significant risk. Adoption and customization should be guided by a Resident Solutions Architect to ensure alignment with your organization's security posture, operational standards, and infrastructure maturity.

# Terraform Agentic Workflows

A framework for agentic Infrastructure as Code development workflows using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — a structured approach that guides AI agents through building production-ready Terraform code with guardrails at every phase. Built on industry standards like [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/) and subagents, this framework is designed to be generic and can be customized to work with any AI coding harness that supports these primitives. Validated with **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot CLI**. Coming soon Project Bob ...

> **Guardrails matter.** Agentic AI for critical infrastructure requires mature IaC practices and strong operational guardrails to deliver successful outcomes. **HCP Terraform** is a key component of this approach — providing remote execution, policy enforcement, state management, and approval workflows that keep AI-generated infrastructure safe and auditable.

## What is this?

This repository is a development template, not a deployed module. It provides orchestrated AI agent workflows for three core Terraform use cases, each following the same structure:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["🔍 Clarify"] --> B["📐 Design"] --> C{"🧑‍💻 Human Review"}
    C --> D["🔨 Implement"] --> E["✅ Validate"] --> F["🚀 PR"]

    style A fill:#4a90d9,stroke:#2c5f8a,color:#fff,rx:8
    style B fill:#6c5ce7,stroke:#4a3db0,color:#fff,rx:8
    style C fill:#e17055,stroke:#b34a3a,color:#fff
    style D fill:#00b894,stroke:#008c6e,color:#fff,rx:8
    style E fill:#fdcb6e,stroke:#c9a224,color:#333,rx:8
    style F fill:#00cec9,stroke:#009e9a,color:#fff,rx:8
```

- **Clarify** — Gather requirements, resolve ambiguity, research AWS/provider docs
- **Design** — Produce a design document with architecture, interfaces, security controls
- **Human Review** — Approve the design before any code is written
- **Implement** — TDD: write tests first, then build to pass them
- **Validate** — Run the full quality pipeline (fmt, validate, test, tflint, trivy, docs)
- **PR** — Create a pull request with the implementation for final review

**Why use this?** Writing production-grade Terraform by hand is slow and error-prone — security defaults get missed, tests are skipped, documentation drifts. SDD with AI agents enforces quality at every phase, producing consistent, tested, documented infrastructure code in a fraction of the time.

**Can't I build my own workflows?** Yes — and many teams do. But getting agentic IaC right is harder than it looks. Naive prompting produces code that works in demos but fails in production: no tests, no security defaults, inconsistent structure, and no guardrails to prevent drift. This framework encodes months of iteration into reusable skills, constitutions, and validation pipelines. You get a proven starting point instead of rebuilding the same lessons from scratch — and because it's built on open standards (agent skills, subagents, MCP), you can extend and customize it rather than being locked in.

**Are these workflows designed to run in the IDE?** These workflows are designed for long-running, background agentic execution — not quick inline completions. We recommend starting in the IDE (VS Code devcontainer) as the fastest path to adoption. As practices mature, these same workflows can be centralized in cloud agent sandboxes such as [AWS AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/agentcore/), decoupling execution from individual developer machines, enabling platform-level orchestration, and unlocking dynamic secrets management for coding agent harnesses.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop, VS Code, GitHub fine-grained PAT, HCP Terraform Team API token, and either a **Claude Code** subscription or **GitHub Copilot** license.

```bash
# 1. Create a new repo from this template on GitHub, then clone it
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/your-new-repo.git
code your-new-repo

# 2. When VS Code prompts, click "Reopen in Container"
#    Choose claude-code or copilot-cli variant depending on your AI assistant

# 3. Validate your environment
bash .foundations/scripts/bash/validate-env.sh
```

All other tools (Terraform, TFLint, terraform-docs, Trivy, Go, GitHub CLI, and more) are pre-installed in the devcontainer.

See the **[Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)** for complete setup instructions including token configuration and branch protection.

## Core Workflows

Start any workflow by typing the slash command in your AI assistant's chat (Claude Code terminal or Copilot Chat). The same slash commands work in both tools:

| Workflow | Purpose | Plan & Design | Implement & Validate |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Module Authoring** | Create reusable Terraform modules with direct provider resources and secure defaults | `/tf-module-plan` | `/tf-module-implement` |
| **Provider Development** | Build Terraform Provider resources using the Plugin Framework | `/tf-provider-plan` | `/tf-provider-implement` |
| **Consumer Provisioning** | Compose infrastructure from private registry modules | `/tf-consumer-plan` | `/tf-consumer-implement` |

## Day 2 Operations

| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger | Agent |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Consumer Module Uplift** | Automated module version upgrades with risk assessment, remediation, and post-merge apply | Dependabot PR | `module-upgrade-remediation` |

The **consumer module uplift** pipeline automates dependency management for consumer configurations:

1. **Dependabot** detects new module versions in the private registry
2. **GitHub Actions** classifies the version bump, runs `terraform plan`, and assesses risk
3. **Low-risk changes** (patch, adds-only) are auto-merged
4. **Breaking changes** trigger `@claude` — an AI agent that fetches the old/new module interfaces, fixes consumer code, and pushes the fix for re-validation

See [Day 2 Operations](docs/getting_started.md#day-2-operations--consumer-module-uplift) for full details.

## MCP Servers

Pre-configured [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers extend AI agent capabilities:

| Server | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `terraform` | HCP Terraform — workspace management, run execution, registry lookups, variable management |
| `aws-documentation-mcp-server` | AWS documentation search, best practices, service recommendations |

Configured in `.mcp.json` and available automatically in the devcontainer.

## What's Included

- **Devcontainer** — One per assistant: `claude-code` (Claude Code CLI) and `copilot-cli` (GitHub Copilot), each with a Docker variant and a rootless-Podman variant (`*-podman`). All ship Terraform 1.14, TFLint, terraform-docs, Trivy, Go 1.24, GitHub CLI, Vault Radar, Infracost, Checkov, golangci-lint, and pre-commit
- **Pre-commit hooks** — fmt, validate, docs, tflint, trivy, secret detection, Vault Radar (requires optional `VAULT_RADAR_LICENSE`)
- **TFLint** — AWS (0.46.0), Azure (0.31.1), and Terraform plugins with all 20 rules configured
- **Constitutions** — Non-negotiable rules for module, provider, and consumer code generation
- **Design templates** — Canonical starting points for each workflow's design phase
- **CI/CD pipelines** — Validation, apply, release, and consumer uplift workflows
